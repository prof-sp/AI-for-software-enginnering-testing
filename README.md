🧠 AI in Software Engineering: Theory, Practice & Ethics
📚 Overview
This project explores the integration of artificial intelligence into modern software engineering workflows. It is divided into three parts: theoretical analysis, practical implementation, and ethical reflection. The goal is to critically assess AI’s impact on development efficiency, testing, predictive analytics, and fairness in decision-making systems.

📖 Part 1: Theoretical Analysis 
🔍 Short Answer Questions
Q1: Explains how AI-driven code generation tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot) accelerate development by suggesting context-aware code snippets, reducing boilerplate, and enhancing productivity. Limitations include over-reliance, lack of domain-specific understanding, and potential for insecure or incorrect suggestions.

Q2: Compares supervised learning (labelled data, e.g., bug vs. no bug) with unsupervised learning (pattern discovery, e.g., anomaly detection) in automated bug detection. Highlights strengths and trade-offs.

Q3: Discusses the importance of bias mitigation in AI-driven personalization, emphasizing risks of reinforcing stereotypes or excluding underrepresented user groups.

📄 Case Study Analysis
Based on the article AI in DevOps: Automating Deployment Pipelines, this section analyzes how AIOps enhances deployment efficiency through:

Intelligent alerting and root cause analysis

Automated rollback and performance optimization

🛠️ Part 2: Practical Implementation 
✨ Task 1: AI-Powered Code Completion
Tool: GitHub Copilot or Tabnine

Task: Write a Python function to sort a list of dictionaries by a key.

Deliverables:

AI-generated vs. manual code comparison

200-word analysis on efficiency, readability, and performance

🧪 Task 2: Automated Testing with AI
Framework: Selenium IDE or Testim.io

Task: Automate login tests for valid/invalid credentials

Deliverables:

Test script

Screenshot of results

150-word summary on AI-enhanced test coverage

📊 Task 3: Predictive Analytics for Resource Allocation
Dataset: Kaggle Breast Cancer Dataset

Goal:

Preprocess data (clean, label, split)

Train Random Forest model to predict issue priority

Evaluate using accuracy and F1-score

Deliverables:

Jupyter Notebook

Performance metrics table

⚖️ Part 3: Ethical Reflection (10%)
Prompt: Reflects on deploying the predictive model in a company setting

Focus:

Risks of bias (e.g., underrepresented teams)

Mitigation strategies using IBM AI Fairness 360

Importance of transparency, fairness, and stakeholder feedback
